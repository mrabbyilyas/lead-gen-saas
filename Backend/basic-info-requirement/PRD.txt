1. Introduction
This document outlines the product requirements for the Lead Generation Application, a backend system designed to automate the process of finding, qualifying, and managing sales leads. The primary interface for this application will be a RESTful API. This PRD details the application's purpose, features, target audience, and technical specifications to guide the development process.

2. Product overview
The Lead Generation Application is a powerful tool designed to streamline and enhance the lead generation efforts of sales and marketing teams. By leveraging automated web scraping, data processing, and intelligent scoring, the application aims to deliver high-quality, actionable leads. It allows users to initiate targeted searches, track the progress of these searches in real-time, retrieve detailed information about potential leads (including company data, contact persons, and business intelligence), and export this data for use in CRM systems or other sales tools. The system is built with a focus on providing comprehensive data, actionable insights, and a robust API for integration.
